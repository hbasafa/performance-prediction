Benchmark different methods to predict industrial wind turbines performance as a case study

# Introduction

In this project, we want to predict wind turbines performance in terms of Power and Torch of the motor as a key performance of the turbines. It is a case study of the industrial infrastructure control project and it can be used for any other technical performance monitoring if there are any available time series data to analyze. We also consider to add other performance monitoring tasks like synthetic control and anamaly detection to best meet the industrial needs. Each task is described as follows, as well as the data intry and models evaluations.

# Data

The project is based on the IOT data made publicly available by Engie for 4 wind turbines in France in La Haute Borne.

To get a better understanding of the data, its parameters and their relationships it might be useful to read the following wiki at [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine_design).
